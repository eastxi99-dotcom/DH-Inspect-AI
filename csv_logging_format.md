# CSV Logging Format for Tablet Visual Inspection

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the standardized CSV logging format for recording inspection results generated by the AI-assisted tablet visual inspection system.

The purpose is to support QC traceability, inspection review, and GMP-oriented documentation requirements.

---

## 2. Logging Scope
The CSV log records the following information:

- Inspection execution details
- Image identification
- Inspection decision outcome
- Basic system traceability data

This log is intended for MVP use and may be expanded in future versions.

---

## 3. File Naming Convention
Each inspection log file should follow a consistent naming convention:
Format:

example:
---

## 4. CSV File Structure
The CSV file consists of one header row followed by inspection result records.

### 4.1 Header Definition

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Date | Inspection date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| Time | Inspection time (HH:MM:SS) |
| Image_ID | Unique identifier assigned to the inspected image |
| Inspection_Result | Final decision (Normal / Defect) |
| Defect_Flag | Binary flag (0 = Normal, 1 = Defect) |
| Review_Status | Manual review requirement (Reviewed / Not Reviewed) |
| Remarks | Optional notes or comments |

## 6. Logging Rules

### 6.1 Mandatory Fields
The following fields must always be recorded:

- Date
- Time
- Image_ID
- Inspection_Result
- Defect_Flag

---

### 6.2 Inspection Result Rules
- Inspection_Result must be either "Normal" or "Defect"
- Defect_Flag must match Inspection_Result
  - Normal = 0
  - Defect = 1

---

### 6.3 Manual Review Status
- Default value: "Not Reviewed"
- Updated to "Reviewed" after QC personnel verification if required

---

## 7. Traceability Considerations
The CSV log enables:

- Inspection history tracking
- Identification of inspection time and image source
- Support for deviation investigation and audit review

This format aligns with basic GMP documentation principles but does not replace official batch records.

---

## 8. Future Expansion
The logging format may be extended to include:

- Defect type classification
- Confidence score or probability
- Inspector or model version identifier
- Batch or lot number linkage

---

## 9. Notes
This CSV logging format is designed for simplicity and clarity in MVP development and may be customized based on site-specific QC requirements and regulatory expectations.

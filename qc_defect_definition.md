# QC-Based Tablet Visual Defect Definition

## 1. Purpose of Visual Inspection
The purpose of tablet visual inspection is to verify the absence of visible defects that may affect product quality, patient safety, and regulatory compliance.  
Visual inspection is a critical quality control step to ensure that only tablets meeting predefined appearance criteria are released.

## 2. Definition of Normal Tablet
A tablet is considered normal when all of the following conditions are satisfied:

- The tablet maintains a uniform and complete shape
- No visible cracks, breakage, or chipping
- No foreign matter adhered to the surface
- Uniform color and surface texture within acceptable limits
- No deformation or abnormal geometry

---

## 3. Classification of Visual Defects

| Defect Type | Definition |
|-------------|------------|
| Crack | A visible line or fracture observed on the tablet surface or edge without complete separation |
| Breakage | Partial or complete loss of tablet structure due to physical separation |
| Chipping | Small fragments missing from the tablet edge or surface |
| Foreign Matter | Presence of unintended material adhered to or embedded in the tablet surface |
| Discoloration | Color deviation from the normal appearance range |
| Shape Deformation | Deviation from the intended tablet geometry (roundness, thickness, symmetry) |

## 4. Visual Inspection Criteria
The following criteria are applied during manual visual inspection:

- Integrity of tablet edges and surface
- Consistency of tablet shape and size
- Surface cleanliness and smoothness
- Color uniformity across the tablet surface

---

## 5. Translation of QC Criteria into AI-Based Evaluation
QC-defined visual inspection criteria are translated into image-based evaluation features as follows:

- Contour continuity and edge integrity analysis
- Area loss ratio relative to a reference normal tablet
- Surface pixel intensity distribution and variance
- Detection of abnormal texture patterns
- Color deviation analysis using grayscale or color histogram features

---

## 6. Application Scope
This defect definition is intended for use in:

- AI-assisted tablet visual inspection systems
- QC reference documentation for model training
- Standardization of defect labeling for dataset construction

## 7. Notes
This document defines baseline visual defect criteria and may be refined based on specific product characteristics, regulatory requirements, and on-site QC standards.
